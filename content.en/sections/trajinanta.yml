    description: |
      My name is Esperanza, and as I always say, I am a trajinanta by birth, who moves heaven and earth until I get the perfect trajin.

      I graduated in business studies when I still didn't know that the creative world existed, until I started to discover the world of events and decoration. I have been training in different expert courses in organization and more specifically in decoration for events.

      I define myself as a constant person, sensitive and intense at the same time, who empathizes and knows how to capture the essence of people, staying true to myself and my style.

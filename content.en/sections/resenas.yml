      It was a delight to be able to count on the services of Pure Trajín for our wedding.

      Esperanza captured our idea perfectly and captured it in a day that we will always remember and all thanks to her.

      Her design and ideas for the wedding we loved and on the wedding day we were able to relax and enjoy it because we knew she was there to make sure everything went smoothly.

      Thank you so much.

      That pure hustle and bustle worked on our wedding and to have the final result of both decoration and direction of the wedding itself has been one of the things that we would never change if we were to go back and organize the wedding again.

      Besides giving us peace of mind and enjoying the whole process, the involvement they have in everything and making everything so easy for us, even the change of venue a week before getting married.

      Esperanza and her entire team are wonderful and 100% recommendable.

      Esperanza was the most important person at our wedding.

      Only she could create a dream and not only that, exceed all our expectations.

      If you trust her you will have the wedding of your dreams and you will never forget every detail and every moment.

      In our case she did it all: flowers, party, decorations of all kinds... and everything incredible.

      All thanks to her.

      She gives you advice, she gives you ideas, she carries it out and on top of that she relaxes you with that sensitivity she has.

      She is pure hustle and bustle and pure peace at the same time.

      Thank you so much, we will never forget everything you did for us.

      You and your team are wonderful!!!!

      We live in Madrid, but our wedding was in Murcia. From the beginning, we knew we needed a wedding planner, and how lucky we were to have met Esperanza.

      Her professionalism and that of her team generate a tranquility and confidence that culminates on the day of the wedding, when the result of all the work done months ago exceeds our expectations.

      We never imagined such a beautiful wedding.

      They took care of everything, down to the last detail. They managed every moment with professionalism and a lot of affection, making us enjoy to the maximum without worrying about anything.

      Without PuroTrajín our wedding would not have been the same.

      We will be eternally grateful to you.

      We're getting married, but that's not all, we're getting married in 4 months! And where do we start? Flowers? invitations? decorations? ...?

      Faced with this scenario we decided to contact Esperanza, and from the first meeting we had with her everything flowed.

      We had some ideas for that day, but Esperanza helped us to make them concrete and materialize them, to make them come true.

      Also, counting on her gave us a lot of peace of mind during those months of nerves, because we were sure that with the passion she puts into her work, everything was going to turn out well.

      We find it incredible how beautiful everything turned out, and we know that without Esperanza's "trajín" it would not have been possible. Thank you very much.

      We got married in November, and it was wonderful to have Esperanza, she couldn't love her work more and it shows.

      She is a person willing to do anything, with a great imagination.

      On our wedding day we were able to enjoy our wedding day knowing that Esperanza was taking care of everything.

      Thank you Esperanza for helping us and taking care of us too. We would definitely choose you again.

      We trusted PuroTrajín to design our wedding (flowers, photocall, sweet table, interior decoration…) and everything turned out wonderfully perfect.

      In addition, Esperanza was always very attentive, solving all our doubts and requests.

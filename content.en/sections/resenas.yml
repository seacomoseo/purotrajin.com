      We're getting married, but that's not all, we're getting married in 4 months! And where do we start? Flowers? invitations? decorations? ...?

      Faced with this scenario we decided to contact Esperanza, and from the first meeting we had with her everything flowed.

      We had some ideas for that day, but Esperanza helped us to make them concrete and materialize them, to make them come true.

      Also, counting on her gave us a lot of peace of mind during those months of nerves, because we were sure that with the passion she puts into her work, everything was going to turn out well.

      We find it incredible how beautiful everything turned out, and we know that without Esperanza's "trajín" it would not have been possible. Thank you very much.

      I can't thank you enough for EVERYTHING Esperanza and her team did, from the choice of suppliers, design, ideas, advice, organization…

      Our wedding was a real festival, what we had always dreamed of!

      Professional, committed, and an incredible problem solving ability!

      Without a doubt the best choice to count on Puro Trajin for our day!

      We got married in November, and it was wonderful to have Esperanza, she couldn't love her work more and it shows.

      She is a person willing to do anything, with a great imagination.

      On our wedding day we were able to enjoy our wedding day knowing that Esperanza was taking care of everything.

      Thank you Esperanza for helping us and taking care of us too. We would definitely choose you again.

      We trusted PuroTrajín to design our wedding (flowers, photocall, sweet table, interior decoration…) and everything turned out wonderfully perfect.

      In addition, Esperanza was always very attentive, solving all our doubts and requests.
